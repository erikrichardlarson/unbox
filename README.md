## How to use
1. **Download the unbox desktop app.** Here's the mac version: [Mac Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/9.0/unbox_mac.zip) and here's the windows version: [Windows Download](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/9.2/unbox_windows.zip) 

**Extra step for Traktor users only: If you're on Traktor, you also need to download this [D2 file](https://github.com/erikrichardlarson/unbox/releases/download/7.0/D2.zip), unzip and just place it in your CSI folder located at C:\Program Files\Native Instruments\Traktor Pro 3\Resources64\qml\CSI on Windows or /Applications/Native Instruments/Traktor Pro 3/Traktor.app/Contents/Resources/qml/CSI on Mac. There is a D2 folder already in this CSI directory so it's best to make a backup of that. And if you don't own a Kontrol D2, go to Controller Manager in your preferences, click Add beneath the device dropdown, and add Traktor then select Kontrol D2. I would automate this for you but permissioning makes it tricky, sorry Traktor users.**

**Denon users: Please make sure your player is online before selecting the Denon mode.**

2. **Open the unbox zip file you downloaded above, and open the unbox app, on Windows you'll want to click the unbox.exe file. When it's open just select your mode. If you select real-time rekordbox on Windows another launcher will come up, select the version of rekordbox you're on in the dropdown and click launch, please leave all other settings intact.** If Windows or Mac asks you to trust unbox, you'll need to do that. The source code is in this repo if you're concerned about security. When the app is open you'll see this window:

</p>

3. **Just keep unbox open when you're playing.** Now that unbox is open, you have access to a few things:  

*  Browser sources. The browser sources are just web pages that unbox automatically updates when it's open. The dropdown on the second step of the app gives you all available sources, on the third step of the app you can copy the link to your clipboard. For example you can add http://localhost:8080/asot.html. Below you can see what these browser sources look like. If your DJ software is running on a different computer than you're streaming OBS on, you can grab the IP address of the computer running unbox / your DJ software and use that in place of localhost for your browser source urls. You'll need to have both machines on the same network to make this work. The now playing overlay could look something like this: http://192.168.0.1:8080/asot.html
 
*  Three txt files. You also have access to a "unbox.txt" file in your home directory in a folder called unbox_output. You can add this as a text source in OBS, it updates in real time so you can display a plain text view of the current playing track. The other two files are artist.txt and track.txt which are just the artist and track separated. 

*  To use KUVO live playlists. Just paste in your user id, click get playlist, and we'll find your latest playlist.

4. **Integrate with Twitch Panel Extension**

* To integrate with the Twitch panel extension you'll need to subscribe to Unbox Pro, this can be done in step four in the Unbox app. Once subscribed you'll get a unique token on each login to Unbox, you can enter this token into the configuration page of the Twitch extension and your tracks will now automatically appear in the Panel Extension. Up to 20 tracks will be displayed to your viewers, and remain there after you close Unbox. This way if your viewers show up late to your set, or miss your set they can still see what you've played. 

### Customize

You can customize the text by adding CSS into the browser source in OBS. One use case would be to add a shadow. This can be useful to brighten or change the background lighting.
You can use [CSS Shadow generator](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/text-shadow/) to help you find the right CSS code. Then just **add** the lines into the existing browser source Custom CSS box in OBS to avoid overriding the pre-existing CSS.
